### Perceptron

This repository contains a Python implementation of Perceptron and showing the process of building and training simple machine learning model.
It also analyzed the limitations of the perceptron using XOR data, which cannot be classified by a single perceptron due to their non-linear separability. 
It then introduced the concept of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which, by incorporating at least one hidden layer, can solve binary classification tasks for non-linearly separable data, as demonstrated with XOR data.
